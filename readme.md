# Retail Stores Analysis Project

## Overview
The Retail Stores Analysis project is a comprehensive study aimed at uncovering insights from retail order data. The project focuses on understanding sales trends, product performance, and regional differences in customer behavior. Using Python, SQL Server, and Power BI, the project transforms raw data into actionable insights that help guide business decisions.

## Project Goals
1. **Data Ingestion and Preparation:** Download, clean, and prepare retail orders data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyze the distribution of orders across various dimensions such as order dates, regions, and product categories.
3. **Sales and Pricing Analysis:** Investigate pricing strategies and their impact on revenue and profits.
4. **Regional and Segment Analysis:** Identify trends in consumer behavior across different regions and segments.
5. **Data Visualization:** Create interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize key insights and trends.
6. **SQL Query Analysis:** Perform advanced data analysis using SQL queries to answer specific business questions.

## Methods
### Data Ingestion and Preparation
- **Tools Used:** Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy)
- **Data Source:** Kaggle retail orders dataset
- **Process:** The data was downloaded, cleaned to handle missing values, and transformed for further analysis.

### Data Cleaning
- **Feature Engineering:** Calculated new fields such as `sale_price`, `discounts`, and `profit`.
- **Data Type Conversion:** Converted date fields and numeric fields to appropriate data types.
- **Dropping Unnecessary Columns:** Removed columns that were not needed for the analysis.

### SQL Server Integration
- **SQL Server Setup:** Connected to SQL Server using SQLAlchemy.
- **Data Loading:** The cleaned data was loaded into SQL Server for further analysis.
- **SQL Queries:** Advanced queries were written to extract insights such as top-performing products, regional sales, and year-over-year growth comparisons.

### Power BI Dashboard
- **Connection to SQL Server:** Imported data from SQL Server into Power BI.
- **Dashboard Creation:** Created interactive visuals to explore the data, including sales trends, regional performance, and product analysis.

## Process
1. **Project Setup:**
   - Installed necessary libraries.
   - Downloaded and prepared the dataset for analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - Handled missing data, performed data type conversions, and engineered new features.
3. **Data Loading:**
   - Loaded the cleaned data into SQL Server for more robust querying and analysis.
4. **SQL Querying:**
   - Ran specific SQL queries to answer critical business questions.
5. **Power BI Integration:**
   - Connected Power BI to SQL Server and created an interactive dashboard to visualize the analysis results.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the power of data-driven analysis in retail. By integrating Python, SQL Server, and Power BI, the project provides valuable insights into sales trends, product performance, and regional customer behavior. The findings from this analysis can be used to inform strategic decisions, optimize pricing strategies, and identify growth opportunities.
